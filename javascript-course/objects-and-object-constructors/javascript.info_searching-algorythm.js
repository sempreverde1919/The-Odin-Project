//Searching algorithm

/*The task has two parts.

Given the following objects:

let head = {
  glasses: 1
};

let table = {
  pen: 3
};

let bed = {
  sheet: 1,
  pillow: 2
};

let pockets = {
  money: 2000
};

1. Use __proto__ to assign prototypes in a way that any property lookup will follow the path: pockets → bed → table → head. For instance, pockets.pen should be 3 (found in table), and bed.glasses should be 1 (found in head).
2. Answer the question: is it faster to get glasses as pockets.glasses or head.glasses? Benchmark if needed.

let head = {

  let table = {
    pen: 3,
    __proto__: head,
  };
  
  let bed = {
    sheet: 1,
    pillow: 2,
    __proto__: table,
  };
  
  let pockets = {
    money: 2000,
    __proto__: bed,
  };
